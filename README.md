Github is *probably* one of the last places on the interwebs to get all political. Still, we can all agree we're being flooded with information, and most of it has a spin. 

I made RSS-Humorize as a simple app to help us get the news without exposing yourself to the spin... by using an LLM to create a different spin. The end result is you can rid yourself of media bullshit by having the app humorize all content. You'll still get all the facts with a generous helping of silliness and none of the fearmongering.

You get content via RSS, prompt an LLM behind the scenes. and receive a humorized version with preserved factual accuracy. Sounds like a gimmick, I know.

This is my first test project in the LLM space (and first in a long time as a software engineer), so heads up. If you're an engineer, you can probably spin up your version that works better for you.
