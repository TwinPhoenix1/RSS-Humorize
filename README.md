Github is *probably* one of the last places on the interwebs where it makes sense to get all political. 

So I won't. 

Still, one thing we can all agree on is we're being flooded with information, and most of it has a spin. 

I made RSS-Humorize as a really simple app to help you get the news without exposing yourself to the spin... by using an LLM to create a different spin.

The point is to rid yourself of media bullshit by having the app humorize any and all content. You'll still get all the facts with a generous helping of silliness and none of the fearmongering.

This is my first test project in the LLM space (and first in a long time as a software engineer), so heads up.
